Scratch GPIO is basically a version of Scratch 1.4 purely designed for the Raspberry Pi. It is pretty much a Scratch 1.4 image converted into a .sh file and 
some extra .py files for different handlers. However, I have found that to use this, download this onto your Raspberry Pi and exactly type in the following
command (without quotes): "tail -n+22 install_scratchgpio3.sh | tar xzv -C ." This should have installed the neccessary files. Now, once you are in your home
directory, type this (again, without the quotes): "./installer.sh" Now, to start Scratch GPIO, type this (once again, without the quotes): "startx" That's it!
