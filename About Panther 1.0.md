So, a thing or two about Panther 1.0. When you start it, it will, after loading, brick itself. Well, at least, that's what you'll probably think. However,
after ~30 seconds of waiting, it will, ironically, "un-brick" itself with an error! All you have to do from this point is to click the "Abandon" button in
the error, and it'll work perfectly fine! That's all I have to say about Panther 1.0.
