How do you use the Scratch addon importer? First, launch Scratch. Then, click the loop in the "R" in the Scratch logo while holding shift; then click "turn fill screen off" > white background > "open..." > "file list" > "Scratch Addon Importer.txt" > [right-click] > "fileIn" > loop in "R" > "turn fill screen on" > loop in "R" "save image for end-user", and you're done! Now, when you click the edit menu, you can choose a Scratch addon!
