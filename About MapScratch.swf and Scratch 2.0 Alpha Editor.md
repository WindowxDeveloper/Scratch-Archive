So, you might see a thing called MapScratch.swf and Scratch Alpha 2.0 Editor.swf. However, these two files CANNOT be played through the online .swf player! To use them, launch Flash Player.exe; then click File > Open... > Browse... > [select MapScratch.swf or Scratch 2.0 Alpha Editor.swf] > Open > Ok > done! If you're a Linux user like me, use Wine. For more information about Wine, please see README.md.
