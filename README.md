# Scratch-Archive
This is an archive of Scratch images from Scratch 0.1 (2003) to Scratch 2.0 (2013), as well as NetScratch, a tested, but never officially released, version of Scratch with "shariables", or variables stored on a NetScratchServer, also available for download here. This archive also contains some non-Scratch (but Scratch-like) programs, such as BYOB (aka Build Your Own Blocks or Snap!) 3.1.3 and 2.0, Panther 1.0, and Streak (1.3.1) 0.1. These images also need a Squeak runtime engine, which can be found here: https://squeak.js.org/run/ To use it, go to the link, drag-and-drop the .image file of the Scratch version/mod. Then, to launch it, go to https://squeak.js.org/run/#image=thenameoftheimagefile.image&swapButtons-true, and replace "thenameoftheimagefile" with the name of the Scratch version/mod. I also have a tutorial how to use and install Scratch 0.1 and 0.2 here: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/436970/. I have also included a special version of Scratch 1.4 designed to run purely on the Raspberry Pi called GPIO Scratch. For more info, see the "About Scratch GPIO.md" file in this repository. For more info about Panther 1.0, see the "About Panther 1.0.md" file in this repository. For more info about Scratch 2.0 or Scratch 2.0 Beta, see the "About Scratch 2.0 and 2.0 Beta.md" file in this repository. For more info about .swf files, see the "About .swf files.md" file in this repository. About .exe files: obviously, on Windows, just run them normally. However, if you're a Linux user like me, use a tool called Wine, the website of which is here: https://winehq.org.
