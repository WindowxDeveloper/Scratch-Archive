# Scratch-Archive
This is an archive of Scratch images from Scratch 0.1 (2003) to Scratch 1.4 (2008), the last Scratch version to use Squeak .image files, as well as NetScratch, a tested, but never officially released, version of Scratch with "shariables", or variables stored on a NetScratchServer, also available for download here. These versions of Scratch also need a Squeak runtime engine, which can be found here: https://squeak.js.org/run/
