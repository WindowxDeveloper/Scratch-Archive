# Scratch-Archive
This is an archive of Scratch images from Scratch 0.1 (2003) to Scratch 1.4 (2008), the last Scratch version to use Squeak .image files, as well as NetScratch, a tested, but never officially released, version of Scratch with "shariables", or variables stored on a NetScratchServer, also available for download here. This archive also contains some non-Scratch (but Scratch-like) images, such as BYOB (aka Build Your Own Blocks or Snap!) and Streak (1.3.1) 0.1. These images also need a Squeak runtime engine, which can be found here: https://squeak.js.org/run/
