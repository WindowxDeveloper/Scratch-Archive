# Scratch-Archive
This is an archive of Scratch images from Scratch 0.1 (2003) to Scratch 1.4 (2008), the last Scratch version to use Squeak .image files, as well as NetScratch, a tested, but never officially released, version of Scratch with "shariables", or variables stored on a NetScratchServer, also available for download here. This archive also contains some non-Scratch (but Scratch-like) images, such as BYOB (aka Build Your Own Blocks or Snap!) 3.1.3 and 2.0, Panther 1.0, and Streak (1.3.1) 0.1. These images also need a Squeak runtime engine, which can be found here: https://squeak.js.org/run/ I also have a tutorial how to use and install Scratch 0.1 and 0.2 [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/436970/) I have also included a special version of Scratch 1.4 designed to run purely on the Raspberry Pi called GPIO Scratch. For more info, see the "About Scratch GPIO.md" file in this repository. For more info about Panther 1.0, see the "About Panther 1.0.md" file in this repository.
